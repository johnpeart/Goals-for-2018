- goal: "Be a better friend"
  description: "Catch up with at least one friend a month"
  max: 12.0
  progress: 7.0
  comment: "I'm chaning the definition of 'done' for this goal, because I've definitely seen a different set of friends (either in person or face-to-face) at least 12 times now. So instead, the goal is to do something sociable at least once a month, instead of being once a month on average. I'm succeeding so far at the new, more stretching goal too."

  stretch: 5.0
  progress: 5.5
  comment: "I have achieved this goal by accident. I started the year planning to launch 'the Department of Bad Ideas', but an opportunity came along to create a podcast for Pride, so I've done that too. I've released 5 episodes of the 'PrideON podcast' now, and recorded a further 2 episodes of 'the Department of Bad Ideas'. So my new stretch goal is to release 10 episodes overall across both podcasts."
